    <p>
      The Chitwan tour package is designed for Nepali adventure wildlife lovers to explore Chitwan's jungle safari and
      Tharu culture. This trip is also known as Sauraha from kathmandu.
      Chitwan Jungle Safari trip - we ride on the back of an elephant or jeep and drive into the jungle. This is an
      exciting way to explore the jungle's wildlife at their natural home in a safe manner. It also offers a close-up
      sight of the one-horn rhino in its natural habitat. Furthermore, numerous species of deer, langur monkeys, wild
      boar, etc., can be witnessed. Over 400 bird species, either as permanent residents or migratory visitors, can be
      viewed on foot in the jungle and open grassland while on bird-watching and jungle walking tours as part of the
      Chitwan adventure trip.
